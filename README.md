# Analyzing-Viral-Evolution
This contains the code called "Mutation-Generator" used for our Assignment 2 project.

It generates a random initial genetic sequence, and then creates a titer table by mutating the initial sequence multiple times and calculating the fitness of each mutation. The goal is to find the mutation with the highest fitness and  can be used to optimize the production of certain proteins or enzymes for biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. By mutating genetic sequences and selecting for those with the highest fitness, we can create new and more efficient ways to produce desired compounds. This can have important implications for industries such as agriculture, energy, and medicine. The genetic sequence space is defined as a list of 64 possible codons. The fitness function simply counts the number of 'G' nucleotides in a given sequence. The code generates a random initial sequence by selecting 9 codons from the sequence space at random. It then sets this initial sequence as the "best sequence" and calculates its fitness as the "best fitness". The titer table is a two-dimensional array with a fixed 40 rows and 50 columns that we set for testing. Each row represents a different round of mutation, and each column represents a different mutation within that round. For each mutation, the code randomly selects one of the 9 codons in the initial sequence to mutate, and replaces it with a new codon chosen at random from the sequence space. It then calculates the fitness of the new sequence and updates the "max fitness" if the new fitness is higher than the previous maximum. Finally, it adds the maximum fitness value to the corresponding cell in the titer table. After all mutations have been performed, the code prints out the best sequence and its fitness, as well as the entire titer table. The titer table was then transferred to be read into the RacMaCS tool to create a antigenic map. Our antigenic map. The code simulates a process of genetic mutation and selection, which is important in understanding how evolution works at a molecular level. By studying genetic mutations and their effects on fitness, we can gain knowledge on how organisms adapt to changing environments, how new species are formed, and how diseases develop. This kind of research can lead to new treatments for genetic disorders and diseases, as well as new technologies for genetic engineering and synthetic biology.

The code will run with fixed data that can be manipulated.
